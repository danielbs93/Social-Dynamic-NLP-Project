## Political trends in Twitter and their sources In the Israeli political Twitter feed

The purpose of this study is to get insights on the Israeli political twitter feed with focus on trends and influencers. Twitter is among the top three social networking sites in the world. Twitter is basically a service that allows registered members to broadcast short posts called tweets. Born in 2006, it has 330 million monthly active users 80 percent of which are mobile.

In this project we are aiming to find political influencers in the Israeli twitter feed. For obvious reasons we cannot measure the influence that some tweet has on some users directly and for that reason we are looking for the connection between users and trends. We assume that some users have the power to cause a phrase become trending, meaning that their posts is an idea that travel through the structure of the social media network. This assumption has a clear bias, an idea can reach users from different sources other than the people they interact with in twitter. For example a person can be exposed to an idea to a tweet from other social media platforms or the
mainstream media and post it on twitter “from scratch”.
